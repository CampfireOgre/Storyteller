# Storyteller Android

To build the sample app:
1. Update `gradle.properties` with your SDK License Key by replacing `[LICENSEKEY]` with the correct value (please refer to our guide on [Getting Started](https://docs.getstoryteller.com/documents/android-sdk/GettingStarted#how-to-add-the-sdk-to-your-project) for more details)
2. Supply your app's API Key in ``MainActivity.kt`` by replacing `[APIKEY]` in `Storyteller.initialize("[APIKEY]")` with the correct value (please refer to our guide on [Getting Started](https://docs.getstoryteller.com/documents/android-sdk/GettingStarted#sdk-initialization) for more details).
